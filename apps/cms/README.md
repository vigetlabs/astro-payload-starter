# Payload CMS App

## Development

### Quick Start

1. First follow the installation instructions in the repo [README](../../README.md).
1. Then run `turbo dev` from the root directory to run all apps in dev mode, or run it from the app/cms directory to only run dev mode for the Payload CMS app.
1. Browse to http://localhost:3000/admin` to access the admin panel.

### Adding New Configuration

Use the included generator to scaffold a new [blocks field](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks) or [collection configuration](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) file in the `src` directory.

```
turbo gen payload-configuration
```
